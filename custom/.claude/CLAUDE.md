- TRIM all generated trailing whitespace
- ADD trailing newline to all files
- After every change:
	- run git add/commit (one-liner)
	- always disable gpg signing: `--no-gpg-sign`
	- commit message:
		- explain in full the changes made
		- include bullet list of ALL prompts since last commit, *VERBATIM*, titled "Prompts:", check conversation log, and check git logs to see where to pick up
		- where prompts are just responses include sufficient context (e.g. " - in response to:"
		- add yourself as co-author in github format
		- if a github bug/feature is completed add a "Fixes <issue-url>" line
		- For fixes/features add the issue id to the end of the commit subject: '(#123)' so that it shows in release notes
		- Use semantic commit prefixes as per cliff.toml - but only for commits worthy of going in release notes, not for every commit
		- Do not repeat issue number in commit subject or semantic commit prefix for subsequent branch commits
- Each commit must be an atomic and coherent change
- Use conventional commit prefixes for anything that would make sense to show in a user-facing changelog (ci:, feat:, etc)
- Mockist testing to be avoided. Outside-in & unit testing is preferred. This improves the system's ability to change.
