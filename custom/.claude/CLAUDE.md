- TRIM all generated trailing whitespace
- ADD trailing newline to all files
- After every change run git add/commit (one-liner) with bullet list of verbatim prompts used titled "prompts:" and yourself as co-author in github format, explaining in full the changes made
- Each commit must be an atomic and coherent change, including an ADR document in doc/adr/ for any significant architectural choices.
- Use conventional commit prefixes (ci:, feat:, etc)
