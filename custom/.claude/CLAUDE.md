- TRIM all generated trailing whitespace
- ADD trailing newline to all files
- After every change:
	- run git add/commit (one-liner)
	- always disable gpg signing: `--no-gpg-sign`
	- commit message:
		- explain in full the changes made
		- include bullet list of all prompts since last commit VERBATIM, titled "Prompts:"
		- add yourself as co-author in github format
		- where prompts are just responses include sufficient context (e.g. " - in response to:"
		- if a github bug/feature is completed add a "Fixes <issue-url>" line
- Each commit must be an atomic and coherent change
- Use conventional commit prefixes for anything that would make sense to show in a user-facing changelog (ci:, feat:, etc)
- Mockist testing to be avoided. Outside-in & unit testing is preferred. This improves the system's ability to change.
