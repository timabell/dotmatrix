[redshift]
; Set the day and night screen temperatures 6500 = no change
temp-day=6500
temp-night=3500

; Enable/Disable a smooth transition between day and night
; - 0 will cause a direct change from day to night screen temperature.
; - 1 will gradually increase or decrease the screen temperature.
; transition=0

; Set the screen brightness. Default is 1.0. (by changing gamma)
; brightness=0.9
brightness-day=1
; brightness-night=0.3 ; bedroom at night darkness, but doesn't go bright enough elsewhere
brightness-night=0.8 ; sitting room at night, less backlight needed

; Set the screen gamma (for all colors, or each color channel individually)
; gamma=0.8
; gamma=0.8:0.7:0.8
; gamma-day=0.8:0.7:0.8
; gamma-night=0.6

; Set the location-provider: 'geoclue', 'geoclue2', 'manual'. Type 'redshift -l list' to see possible values. The location provider settings are in a different section.
; location-provider=manual

; Set the adjustment-method: 'randr', 'vidmode'. Type 'redshift -m list' to see all possible values. 'randr' is the preferred method, 'vidmode' is an older API, but works in some cases when 'randr' does not. The adjustment method settings are in a different section.
; adjustment-method=randr

; Configuration of the location-provider: Type 'redshift -l PROVIDER:help' to see the settings. E.g.: 'redshift -l manual:help' Keep in mind that longitudes west of Greenwich (e.g. the Americas) are negative numbers.
[manual]
lat=51.3598
lon=-1.1485

; Configuration of the adjustment-method. Type 'redshift -m METHOD:help' to see the settings. E.g.: 'redshift -m randr:help' In this example, randr is configured to adjust screen 1. Note that the numbering starts from 0, so this is actually the second screen. If this option is not specified, Redshift will try to adjust _all_ screens.
; [randr]
; screen=1
